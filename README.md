# cctea

The Lua binding for the XXTEA used in cocos2d-x project.

## About the license

Yes I know it is strange this module is licensed under The PHP License.

It is because that the XXTEA used in cocos2d-x is copied form the https://github.com/liut/pecl-xxtea.
And that code is licensed under The PHP License. I have asked [here](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x-3rd-party-libs-bin/issues/197).
